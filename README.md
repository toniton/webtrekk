A frontend display of my skills that shows the list and details of characters in the starwars movie.
This project showcases catalogue of characters in Star Wars, and gives you the ability to search for your favourite characters. You are also able to see their extra information like what planet they’re from and what year they’re born. It like to know what other people come from that same planet, you can see that as well.
